In this location based game the gamer will find himselfâ€‹ on the moon with mapped earth GPS data. Herefore we map pictures from moon surface to earth
coordinates. Every Apollo mission correlates one level, where the player has to get to point of interests where he find mini missions he has to solve,
which are related to real special events from the Apollo missions. The goal of the game is to teach people about space and Apollo missions without
having the impression to lern something. The player gets feeling for distances walked and driven by the rovers and will also experince the difficulties
and successes from the mission. It is planned to expand the app for other planets like mars.
