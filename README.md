In this location based game the player will find himself on the moon with mapped GPS data from earth. Herefore we map pictures from moon surface to earth
coordinates. The player has to walk around on earth and the location will be shown on moon.

Every Apollo mission correlates to one level. The player has to get to point of interests where he finds mini missions he has to solve to get points to
commpete in the google leadership. These missions are related to real special events from the Apollo missions.

The goal of the game is to teach people about space and Apollo missions without having the impression of getting teached. The player gets feeling for
distances walked and driven by the rovers and will also experince the difficulties and successes from the mission. The goal is to give people more
knowledge about the space and bring back the feeling of first rocket missions. It is planned to expand the app for other planets like mars.
